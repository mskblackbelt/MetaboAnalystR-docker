## Description 

MetaboAnalystR 4.0 contains the R functions and libraries underlying the popular MetaboAnalyst web server, including metabolomic data analysis, visualization, and functional interpretation. The package is synchronized with the MetaboAnalyst web server. After installing and loading the package, users will be able to reproduce the same results from their local computers using the corresponding R command history downloaded from MetaboAnalyst web site, thereby achieving maximum flexibility and reproducibility. 

#### If you prefer using the web-based platform in a local environment, we provide long-term stable (LTS) release of [MetaboAnalyst-Pro](https://www.xialab.ca/pro/protools.xhtml) with Enterprise Solution for local installation. Please [contact us](https://www.xialab.ca/pro/contact.xhtml).

The version 4.0 aims to address three key challenges facing global metabolomics. By leveraging the best practices established by the community, MetaboAnalyst R 4.0 offers three key features: 
1) an auto-optimized feature detection and quantification module for LC-MS1 spectra processing;
2) a streamlined MS/MS spectra deconvolution and compound annotation module for both data-dependent acquisition (DDA) or data-independent acquisition (DIA); 
3) a sensitive and debiased functional interpretation module for functional analysis directly from LC-MS and MS/MS results. 

MetaboAnalystR 4.0 comes with a large collection of knowledgebases (~500,000 entries of metabolite sets) and spectra databases (~1.5 million MS2 spectra) to support local large-scale processing or using our API service. 
 
Our comprehensive benchmark studies show that MetaboAnalystR 4.0 can significantly improve the quantification accuracy and identification coverage of the metabolome. Serial dilutions demonstrate that MetaboAnalystR 4.0 can accurately detect and identify > 10% more high-quality MS and MS/MS features. For both DDA and DIA datasets, MetaboAnalystR 4.0 can increase the true positive rate of chemical identification by > 40% without increasing false identifications. The increased coverage and accuracy enable more accurate biological insights. In conclusion, MetaboAnalystR 4.0 provides an efficient pipeline that bridges LC-MS/MS data processing to biological insights in the open-source R environment.

## Getting Started

### Docker instructions

If you have Docker available, you can get started with the following command
```docker
docker-compose up -d
```
This should download all necessary files, build the container, then run it. Navigate to the resulting 

### Step 1. Install package dependencies 

To use MetaboAnalystR 4.0, first install all package dependencies. Ensure that you have necessary system environment configured. 

For Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04/20.04): libcairo2-dev, libnetcdf-dev, libxml2, libxt-dev and libssl-dev should be installed at frist;

For Windows (e.g. 7/8/8.1/10): Rtools should be installed.

For Mac OS: In order to compile R for Mac OS, you need Xcode and GNU Fortran compiler [installed](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/). We suggest you follow these [steps](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/) to help with your installation.

R base with version > 3.6.1 is recommended. The compatibility of latest version (v4.0.0) is under evaluation. As for installation of package dependencies, there are two options:

**Option 1** 

Enter the R function (metanr_packages) and then use the function. A printed message will appear informing you whether or not any R packages were installed.

Function to download packages:

```R
metanr_packages <- function(){

  metr_pkgs <- c("impute", "pcaMethods", "globaltest", "GlobalAncova", "Rgraphviz", "preprocessCore", "genefilter", "sva", "limma", "KEGGgraph", "siggenes","BiocParallel", "MSnbase", "multtest","RBGL","edgeR","fgsea","devtools","crmn","httr","qs")
  
  list_installed <- installed.packages()
  
  new_pkgs <- subset(metr_pkgs, !(metr_pkgs %in% list_installed[, "Package"]))
  
  if(length(new_pkgs)!=0){
    
    if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
        install.packages("BiocManager")
    BiocManager::install(new_pkgs)
    print(c(new_pkgs, " packages added..."))
  }
  
  if((length(new_pkgs)<1)){
    print("No new packages added...")
  }
}
```
Usage of function:
```R
metanr_packages()
```

**Option 2** 

Use the pacman R package (for those with >R 3.5.1). 

```R
install.packages("pacman")

library(pacman)

pacman::p_load(c("impute", "pcaMethods", "globaltest", "GlobalAncova", "Rgraphviz", "preprocessCore", "genefilter", "sva", "limma", "KEGGgraph", "siggenes","BiocParallel", "MSnbase", "multtest","RBGL","edgeR","fgsea","httr","qs"))
```
### Step 2. Install the package

MetaboAnalystR 4.0 is freely available from GitHub. The package documentation, including the vignettes for each module and user manual is available within the downloaded R package file. You can install the MetaboAnalylstR 3.0 via any of the three options: A) using the R package devtools, B) cloning the github, C) manually downloading the .tar.gz file. Note that the MetaboAnalystR 3.0 github will have the most up-to-date version of the package. 

#### Option A) Install the package directly from github using the *devtools* package. Open R and enter:

Due to issues with Latex, some users may find that they are only able to install MetaboAnalystR 4.0 without any documentation (i.e. vignettes). 

```R
# Step 1: Install devtools
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

# Step 2: Install MetaboAnalystR with documentation
devtools::install_github("xia-lab/MetaboAnalystR", build = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE, build_manual =T)

# Step 2: Install MetaboAnalystR without documentation
devtools::install_github("xia-lab/MetaboAnalystR", build = TRUE, build_vignettes = FALSE)

```

#### Option B) Clone Github and install locally

The * must be replaced by what is actually downloaded and built.  

```R
git clone https://github.com/xia-lab/MetaboAnalystR.git
R CMD build MetaboAnalystR
R CMD INSTALL MetaboAnalystR_4.0.0.tar.gz

```

#### Option C) Manual download of MetaboAnalystR_3.0.3.tar.gz and install locally

Manually download the .tar.gz file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHRUzXFDukWXEKxTLMF9X1fHRN06uFFu/view?usp=sharing). 

```R
cd ~/Downloads
R CMD INSTALL MetaboAnalystR_3.0.3.tar.gz

```

## Case Studies

### MetaboAnalystR 3.0: Towards an Optimized Workflow for Global Metabolomics

The case studies have been preformed in our article of this version [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/10/5/186) (available online now). The example running R code of this article have been provided as a vignette inside the R package.


### MetaboAnalystR 2.0: From Raw Spectra to Biological Insights

The R scripts to perform all of the analysis from our previous manuscript "MetaboAnalystR 2.0: From Raw Spectra to Biological Insights" can be found [here](https://github.com/jsychong/MetaboAnalystR/tree/master/MetaboAnalystR_2_Supplementary_Data).

The detailed tutorial of the outdated version to perform a comprehensive end-to-end metabolomics data workflow from raw data preprocessing to knowledge-based analysis still works. The tutorial is available as a PDF is also available inside the R package as a vignette.

### MetaboAnalystR 1.0:  flexible and reproducible analysis of metabolomics data
To demonstrate the functionality, flexibility, and scalability of the MetaboAnalystR v1.0.0 package, three use-cases using two sets of metabolomics data is available [here](https://github.com/jsychong/MetaboAnalystR/tree/master/Supplementary_Material). In this folder you will find detailed discussions and comparisons with the MetaboAnalyst web-platform.

## Tutorials

For detailed tutorials on how to use MetaboAnalystR 4.0, please refer to the R package vignettes. These vignettes include detailed step-by-step workflows with example data for each of the main MetaboAnalytR 4.0 modules, a case-study showcasing the new end-to-end functionality of MetaboAnalystR 4.0. The raw data processing workflow has been accelerated and gradually mature. Note, the functions below work only if the R package vignettes were built. 

Within R:
```R
vignette(package="MetaboAnalystR")
```

Within a web-browser:
```R
browseVignettes("MetaboAnalystR")
```
